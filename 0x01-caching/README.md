**What a caching system is**

A caching system is a component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. It stores a copy of the data, the location of which is determined by a key that is associated with the data. When a program needs the data, it first checks the cache to see if the data is there. If it is, the cached version is returned, which is quicker than fetching the original data. If the data is not in the cache, it is retrieved from the original source and stored in the cache for future use [Source 1](https://realpython.com/lru-cache-python/), [Source 2](https://towardsdatascience.com/complete-guide-to-caching-in-python-b4e37a4bcebf).

**What FIFO means**

FIFO stands for First In, First Out. It is a type of queue management strategy where the data that enters first is the one that gets removed first. This is commonly used in caching systems to determine which items to remove when the cache is full.

**What LIFO means**

LIFO stands for Last In, First Out. It is another type of queue management strategy where the most recent item added is the first one to be removed. This strategy is commonly used in stack data structures but can also be applied in caching systems.

**What LRU means**

LRU stands for Least Recently Used. It is a common page replacement policy used in caching systems. When a cache is full and needs to make room for new data, it removes the data that was least recently used. This strategy helps keep the most relevant data in the cache [Source 1](https://realpython.com/lru-cache-python/).

**What MRU means**

MRU stands for Most Recently Used. Similar to LRU, it is a page replacement policy used in caching systems. However, unlike LRU which removes the least recently used data, MRU removes the most recently used data when the cache is full.

**What LFU means**

LFU stands for Least Frequently Used. It is another page replacement policy used in caching systems. When a cache is full and needs to make room for new data, it removes the data that has been used the least number of times.

**What the purpose of a caching system**

The main purpose of a caching system is to improve the performance of a system by reducing the amount of time it takes to retrieve data. By storing frequently accessed data in a cache, the system can retrieve this data quickly without having to fetch it from the original source every time. This reduces the load on the original source and can lead to faster response times for the system [Source 1](https://realpython.com/lru-cache-python/), [Source 2](https://towardsdatascience.com/complete-guide-to-caching-in-python-b4e37a4bcebf).

**What limits a caching system have**

There are several limitations to caching systems:

* Size Limitations: Caches have a finite size, and once the cache is full, older data must be removed to make room for new data.
* Inconsistency: Because caches are often distributed across multiple servers, there can be inconsistencies between different caches. This can lead to situations where a user sees different versions of the same data.
* Overhead: There is an overhead associated with managing the cache, including deciding what data to store, when to evict data, and how to handle cache misses.
* Stale Data: Data in the cache may become stale if it changes in the original source but the change is not reflected in the cache.
* Memory Consumption: Depending on the size of the cache and the complexity of the data being stored, caching can consume a significant amount of memory [Source 2](https://towardsdatascience.com/complete-guide-to-caching-in-python-b4e37a4bcebf), [Source 4](https://oxylabs.io/blog/python-cache-how-to-use-effectively).
